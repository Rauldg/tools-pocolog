== What is pocolog ?

This package allows to manipulate (read and write) log files of the pocolog
format, as generated by the the pocosim[1] simulator and the orocos/logger
component. These log files contain streams of timestamped binary data, along
with a Typelib[2] XML definition of the binary data (thus ensuring that the file
will remain readable).
